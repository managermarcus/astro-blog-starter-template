			<h2>Bluegrass Mandolin & Guitar Coaching</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to my page for mando and guitar lessons. My approach to lessons focuses on 
				technique building blocks, working through challenges, and fixing bad habits. Those 
				are the things that actually get people sounding better and moving from beginner
				to intermediate. There are lots of lessons and content available online to teach you licks and tunes
				but some things that just work better when you're sitting in a room together. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm not the best mandolin or guitar player in the world. Heck, I'm probably not the best
				picker in most jams I join. But the best pickers often started playing when they were small
				and while they may understand the music, they don't always understand the struggle. I started playing 
				bluegrass in my late 20s and none of it came easy for me, and that's how I know I can help you.  
			</p>
			<p>My goal is to make you the best picker you can be. If you're interested in working together, drop me a line.
				I'm based in Edmonton, AB and do not offer online lessons. </p>
